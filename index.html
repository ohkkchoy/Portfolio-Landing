    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm most happy riding my bike and listening to tunes. General nature and outdoors tickles my fancy. My professional life involves body fluids of all kinds and staying up all night long. I embrace and find new experiences when I can, but I'm never opposed to chillin'.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I have two bachelor's degrees, one in psychology and one in biology. I have one associates degree in laboratory science. I had been in the service industry for 15 years until I became a medical technologist. It's time for a new chapter! I wish I had more prior experience with computers and coding, but here I am now! </p>
